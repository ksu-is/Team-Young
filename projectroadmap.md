3) Try to figure out why the code is not wokring. I cant seem to figure it out. DONE
4) I have searched for hours so now I am going to reach out for help.DONE 
5) I just met with Farha and I figured out why the code wasnt wokring in visual studios. It is because the code was written in java script. I feel dumb haha!DONE 
6) I begin to look for a new code repository in Guthub that is written in python. DONE 
7) I found a code repository that is in the correct coding language. It is called: "to-do-list-tkinter-/gui_todo.py" DONE
8) Next, I open the code in visual studios to see if I can get it to run. DONE
9) I research on youtube and other websites to figure out how to get it to run. DONE
10) I got the code to run. Now I replace my old java code with the new code on found on me "README"DONE
11) The new code is now in the "readme" document. DONE
12) I will now begin to make changes to personalize the code to match my ideas for the project. DONE
13) The first thing is change the name of the "to-do list" to the name of my project the "daily grind list". I edit the code on lines 14 and line 113.
14) I then change the window color from white to blue on line 11 of the code. 
15) On line 49 of the code, I change the code from saying "please enter task" to "Please enter your daily grind" 
16) On like 68, I have to change the code from displaying "There are {a certain #} tasks left" to "There are {} tasks left in your daily grind. 
17) On line 77, I change the code from saying "are you sure you want to delete task" to "are you positive you want to delete te this daily grind?" 
18) On line 100, I change the "are you sure yo want to delete all tasks" to "are you sure you want to delete te your entire daily grind list?" 
19) On line 128, I change "Number of tasks" to "Number of daily grinds"
20) On line 143, I change the "Random task" to "random daily grind" 
21) I then run the code to see how to the code changes have effected my GUI.
